Small very hacky renderer (ray-marching path-tracer) written in Processing 4 (mostly plain Java) for the Fractals course at TUW.

### Controls:
- W, A, S, D to move
- Mouse to look around
- Mouse wheel to change movement speed
- ESC to quit

*The Project has inbuild shader hot reloading, to make iterating on fractal ideas faster :)*
